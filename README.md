This project contains the high-resolution images and executable codes of the paper named "Domain-adapted feature transfer: a generalized framework for short term vessel speed prediction".
In the executable_code folder, "Main" is the main function needs to be run, containing SRF and DAFT-SRF models, which is controlled by the parameter "F".
Meanwhile, we provide two datasets of Tr1 and Te1 used in the study.
